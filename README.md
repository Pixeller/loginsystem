# loginsystem
Just a stupidly made very simple login / sign up project which uses SQLite database to remember the already done accounts.
As I know you should modify the SQLite database to either centralized one or change the whole SQLite to seomething else for the accounts to sync with eachother (as in if you create an account on your PC, it would
also work on your friends PC)

Thought I'd share this since I was bored and used way too much time to create something so useless.
